        <h1>History and Vision of BandDad.com: It’s New, Must Be Fun, and Wise</h1>

        <p>At AmericanBandDad.com, we're on a mission to bring fathers into the heart of their children's musical journeys with the same enthusiasm and support that they would if their kids were star athletes destined for the major leagues. Our vision revolves around creating a close-knit fraternity of mission-driven men who share their wisdom and experiences as they navigate the world of music alongside their young musicians.</p>

        <p>Enter Wendell Bud McFarland, the fictional National President of the American Band Dad Association, a character born from our collective imagination. Wendell is here to be your guide, mentor, and friend, as he spreads the wealth of experiential knowledge to band dads all across America. Together, we're forging connections, fostering understanding, and nurturing a genuine love for music.</p>

        <p>But that's not all – we have exciting plans for AmericanBandDad.com! While the website itself will always be freely accessible, we'll be offering a merchandise center where ABDA members can proudly sport American Band Dad t-shirts, sweatshirts, baseball caps, and even own a portrait of the legendary Wendell Bud McFarland himself, National President of the American Band Dad Association.</p>

        <p>However, the true magic of AmericanBandDad.com lies in the opportunities it presents. Through this platform, we'll also be highlighting our sister websites: NationalScholasticMusiciansAwards.com, NationalScholasticJuniorMusiciansAwards.com, Accoladi.com, HollywoodSightreading.com, and MyMusicFuture.com. We believe in a holistic approach to nurturing young talents, and these websites offer valuable resources and opportunities for budding musicians.</p>

        <p>In our endeavor to make AmericanBandDad.com even more exciting and engaging, we've enlisted the talents of a 2023 summer intern, Brady Defelice, an Illustration Major at the Savannah School of Art and Design. With his creative genius, he's brought Wendell Bud McFarland to life, capturing his essence on the digital canvas.</p>

        <p>And that's not all! We're thrilled to introduce Randall Bayne, a master storyteller, who will be the driving force behind our site's podcast series. Throughout September and the early days of October, Randall will be recording a series of captivating podcasts as Wendell. These podcasts will not only delve into the world of American Band Dads and feature the subject-specific wisdom of Wendell Bud McFarland, but they will also offer interactive experiences to keep you engaged and entertained.</p>

        <p>So, welcome to AmericanBandDad.com, where music meets fatherhood, and where a shared passion for nurturing young talents unites us all. Yes, for a team of 2023 Fall Interns you have the opportunity to bring this vision further to life and to the American public as you create the website where Wendel Bud McFarland and the American Band Dad Association will live. Here's to the power of music, mentorship, and camaraderie!</p>
